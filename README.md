The hypothetical Microsoft Studios is starting their streaming platform and looking for any advice they can get. This project uses datasets gathered in 2019 from four different online databases to make specific reccomendations for the upcoming platform and their future endeavors in film.
When the data sets are imported and cleaned, lets inspect the first five elements and the DataFrame information. We see that the merges produced extra columns where redundant column names needed to be differentiated. Many of these can be ignored for our purposes. Looking closer, we notice that the values in release_date_x and release_date_y do not match. Only one of these values can be correct, and a cursory internet search tells us that the release_date_y values are correct, so we will be using those values for release date considerations.
